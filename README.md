<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

I created this project to show what a complex structure we have and how important it is to have an understanding of it in order to maintain our health at the proper level.

I used a functional component - the useState hook. I used the map() method, also used the filter() method, with its help I showed organ systems that you can still read about. And the subString() method to partially show the information.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

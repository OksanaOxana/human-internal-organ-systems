<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

 This project will help the employer get an idea of ​​me as an employee.


Every developer, when looking for a job, must have a project to demonstrate to the employer. That's why I created this project. 


I'm Oksana. I am a front-end developer from Belarus. I have learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Figma, Gsap, Git. 

And now I’m looking for a job where I can put my skills into practice, where I can become part of a team and benefit the company.

I try to learn something new every day and now I am learning React.

I created this project to show what a complex structure we have and how important it is to have an understanding of it in order to maintain our health at the proper level.

I used a functional component - the useState hook. I used the map() method, also used the filter() method, with its help I showed organ systems that you can still read about. And the subString() method to partially show the information.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
